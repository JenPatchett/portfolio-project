### Problem Solved

A custom designed business website for a local electrician with prominently displayed 'request a callback' buttons linked to a contact form.

<br>

### Technologies Used

- HTML
- Bootstrap
- Custom CSS
- JavaScript
- Nunjucks
- 11ty
- Netlify

<br>

### Challenges Faced

The carousel with feature text took a lot of development and testing on a range of screen sizes to get the font sizes fully responsive and 'just right', but was worth the time spent!

<br>

### Lessons Learned

As a former software tester, I went to town on the responsive font size development and testing to ensure it was clear and displayed well on different devices. This took longer than originally estimated but it was a great learning opportunity.
