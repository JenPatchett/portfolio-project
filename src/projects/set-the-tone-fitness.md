### Problem Solved

An existing e-commerce website with fitness class booking functionality hosted on Wix. I was hired to update and enhance the website with additional features and improve accessibility.

### Technologies Used

- HTML
- Custom CSS
- Wix

### Challenges Faced

When I took on this client, I had not previously used Wix so needed to allow additional time to upskill and research some of the features I was asked to implement. It was initially a challenge accessing the backend code, version control and testing environments, but once set up I quickly found my way around. 

### Lessons Learned

Allow more time than you think you need when taking on existing projects, or starting a new project with technologies you're unfamiliar with!
