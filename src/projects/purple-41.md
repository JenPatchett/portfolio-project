### Problem Solved

I designed and built a custom website for my tech startup Purple 41 Web Design as a freelance web developer.

### Technologies Used

- HTML
- Bootstrap
- Custom CSS
- JavaScript
- Nunjucks
- 11ty
- Netlify

### Challenges Faced

It took some trial and error to get the Hero / carousel to display in the way I had planned. 

### Lessons Learned

It is important to test on a range of devices and operating systems, and not rely solely on Chrome browser's built-in responsive dev tools!
