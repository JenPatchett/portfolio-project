### Problem Solved

I designed, built and hosted this portfolio website to showcase my web design and development skills.

<br>

### Technologies Used

- HTML
- Bootstrap
- Custom CSS
- JavaScript
- Nunjucks
- 11ty
- Netlify

<br>

### Challenges Faced

I initially faced some challenges around adding custom styling to some Bootstrap elements but after a lot of trial-and-error the perseverence paid off. Additionally, I had some issues importing the 11ty Images package but once resolved found this feature great for dynamically displaying images on individual Project pages.

### Lessons Learned

Version control is essential for keeping a live, working version of the site published whilst developing on feature branches and testing in the background. Committing regularly helps when things don't go to plan and history needs to be stepped through, or issues undone.
